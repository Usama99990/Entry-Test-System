Entry Test System - Assembly Language COAL Project

This Entry Test System, developed using Assembly Language, is a project for the Computer Organization and Assembly Language course. It provides an interactive console-based application to simulate an entry test system with features including:
- User Interaction: Presents questions and captures user responses via keyboard input.
- Scoring Mechanism: Implements logic to calculate and display scores based on user answers.
- Low-Level Programming: Showcases the use of assembly instructions for input/output handling, memory operations, and control flow.
- Learning-Oriented: Focuses on understanding the fundamentals of computer organization and the execution of low-level instructions.

This project serves as an excellent resource for students and enthusiasts to explore assembly language programming and its practical applications.
